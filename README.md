# UPLIFT (Team Samarthya)
Concetto + Hackfest'22 project

The idea of this website first germinated in our minds when one of our teammates
discussed his neighbor’s daughter who got through a reputed engineering college in
our country, however, due to unfavorable circumstances propelled during the
pandemic, she found herself unable to pay for the tuition and admission fee on time
Her father lost his job recently and her mother was a homemaker Her rather
underprivileged background further increased the inaccessibility of helpful
information from her reach

This is where our website will fill the current gap in the market. We wanted to
provide our users with a one stop solution for their education and career needs. One
may ask how we plan to stand out in a market full of websites providing information
about jobs and internships, however, we have envisioned a platform that will be
unique in more than one way.
